# Mazij
Mazij is a collaborative mashup application designed by a group of students from Heriot-Watt University as a part of their Software Engineering and Professional Development courses in Year 3 of their Computer Science degree.  
The code is functioning but some files have not been cleaned (unnecessary code has been put as comments but not removed yet).

**For detailed information or clarifications, contact us at hwumazij@gmail.com!**
